<h1> Feelings About Debugging</h1>
<pre>
I had a partner (Lucia) and she would catch mistakes that I missed. That lessened the amount of debugging that I had to do. Having her made programming easier.
At times, we ran into bugs that required the help of a teacher. When we had to ask for help, I learned new information. Learning makes me happy because I know I am
becoming smarter. Debugging can be frustrating when the problem is not figured out, but when things do work out I feel very good.
