<h1>Lessons from Erin Hall's Talk</h1>

<h2>CS in College and Beyond</h2>
<pre>
  I learned that (at least in Erin's college), there are not many
  women in computing related courses (e.g. EE, CS). Because of this, she
  was able to break out of her shell and ask more questions. She gained
  confidence and became an outstanding student in her classes. Erin also
  mentioned that the basics and languages that one learns in college is not
  enough when doing work in the real world. There are many different languages
  and skills related to CS. Though when one has learned one language, it is
  easy to learn another.

<h2>Main Takeaways</h2>
<pre>
  1. You are not learning if you are not being challenged.
  2. Make sure you are asking the best person to answer your questions.
  3. Act confident and then become confident.
